# Image-enhancement
Images captured by cameras may contain distortions due to imperfections in lens and CCDS which results in Image blur, warping and addition of noise. In this project, we did some research and performed the Inverse filtering technique to get a better enhanced image. The inverse filters are designed based on the blur and noise spectrum
